# Snake-game
This is a console-based Snake Game written in C++. It includes two new features: Speed Increase with Score and Random Obstacles. The game provides a fun and challenging experience as the snake gets faster the longer you survive.

Features
Speed Increase with Score: As the player collects more fruits, the speed of the snake increases, making the game progressively more challenging.
Random Obstacles: Random obstacles are generated on the field. If the snake collides with an obstacle, the game ends.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right

For 2-player mode (if enabled), Player 2 can use the following keys:
W: Move up
S: Move down
A: Move left
D: Move right
The goal is to eat as many fruits (*) as possible to grow the snake.
Avoid hitting the walls, obstacles (#), or the snake's own body.
As your score increases, the snake will move faster.
Colliding with obstacles or the walls will end the game.
